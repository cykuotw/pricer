## Running the Project

### With Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> **Warning:** Total image size can be up to **2.5â€¯GB**.

### Dev Without Docker

#### Start backend:

Please have Go 1.23 installed. (Go Official: https://go.dev/doc/install)

```bash
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest  # if you do not have air installed
air
```

#### Start frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Price Simulation

-   Uses Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
-   Parameters from `data/initParam.json`
-   Tickers updated per minute using goroutines
-   Exposed via `/stream/update-price/` (SSE)

---

## Assumptions

-   User count is fewer than 10, so there's no need to scale for a high number of concurrent users.
-   Market is assumed to be open daily from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM, ignoring holidays and weekends.
-   Users will only access the service during market open hours and will reopen it the next day.
-   Users are experienced traders who are familiar with pricing models such as GBM.
-   Prices are not persisted or stored.

---

## Possible Future Improvements

-   **Improve time synchronization** (e.g., use an NTP server) along with higher-precision data types (e.g., `decimal.Decimal`).
-   **Increase precision in price simulation**:
    -   It's unclear how much floating-point error may affect the accuracy of simulated prices.
    -   If the error proves significant, switching to a decimal-based type should be considered.
-   **Consider a lighter backend framework**:
    -   Gin is a solid choice for building Go backends, but there are lighter and faster alternatives available depending on future scale.
-   **Consider using a DBMS** (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) to store prices:
    -   In real-world scenarios, thousands of stock tickers may need to be monitored, and an in-memory buffer could become a bottleneck.
-   **Transition to an event-driven architecture**:
    -   In real-world scenarios, thousands of stock tickers may need to be monitored, which could exceed the limits of a monolithic system.
-   **Enhance observability in a distributed system** (e.g., via OpenTelemetry):
    -   Currently, the system only prints error messages; proper error handling and structured logging are needed for production readiness.
    -   Richer telemetry data enables engineers to make informed decisions, especially during on-call incidents.
